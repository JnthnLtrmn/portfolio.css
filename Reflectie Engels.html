  <h3>Strong points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Analyzing: One of my strengths is analyzing code and studying step by step what when
      happens. This way I also look at how it is laid out and can determine how something is put together.
    </li>
    <li>Eager to learn: Learning about something in an ever-changing world is a big plus that I carry with me. To
      learn something is a motivation that stimulates me. Also to update existing knowledge gives me a
      motivation.
    </li>
    <li>Structure: For me, structure is a way of working logically. By working in a structured way
      you keep an overview of what you are doing. If there is a problem, it can also be easier to
      search for a solution of the problem.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-effective: I misjudge myself where the result usually comes out better than what I thought myself
      had. the result can also be wrong, but I learn from this by looking at what I have to do next time
      pay attention.
    </li>
    <li>Rudderless: Because I prefer to work step by step, it becomes difficult for me to determine how to
      start a project. My knowledge of programming is still limited for this, but this will improve
      by working more with this.
    </li>
    <li>Concretize: Due to my limited knowledge, I do not always know what should be used where and when.
      Because of this I can sometimes get stuck, which means that time is lost looking for work.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>POP session: Personal branding</h3>
  <p>At this session we learned how important it is to appear professional through social media channels. There
    became clear given what makes a professional 'business card' and what data it contains. At this
    session we created a Linkd-in account and you quickly saw how important this platform is to make connections
    within the IT world. With all the do's and dont's we were provided with the knowledge needed to get us into it later in the work
    field to give the right first impression.</p>
