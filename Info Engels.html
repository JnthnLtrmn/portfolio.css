    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Here i present you myself, my name is Jonathan Loterman, 31 years living in Heusden-Zolder.<br>
        After my highschool i went to work in different kinds of sectors to find out what is was calling for me.
        <br>
        After a couple of years in the workfield, i had the feeling that i wasn't able to work my worth and wasn't
        achieving something.<br>
        So i started looking for an education witch seemed to be more in the field i would like to work in.
        In that way i found out about an education of programing in witch i can let my creativity and analytic skills
        grow and be in good use.
        To designing of an applivation and help designing websites is a goal i can achieve through this way</p>

<div id="Opleiding" class="divbody">

    <h3>Why this education?</h3>
    <p>Why iv'e chosen this education is because it gives me a challenge and has triggered a motivation in me to achieve
        this.
        Afte doing a lot of research i ended with this education. It always a dream to study something at Highschool
        because the skill level is higher than middle school and other educations that i followed.
        Specially at the Highschool PXL where i used to walk by when i was in middleschool gives a boost to me.
        It also is an education where in you can quickly find a decent job and there are a lot of job oppertunities.</p>

    <h3>Choise of profession</h3>
    <p>Before i signed in to this education i informed myself how it would be working as a programmer.
        The thing i liked the most was the creativity there is and all the possibilities there are in this sector.
        An other positive thing in this sectozr is the growth where in there changes a lot so you can learn new
        techniques and sharpen my skills.
        After having heard a couple of speakers at school i noticed the flexibility with time managment, it all ends
        that as long as the customer is happy, you can handle it the way you like.
        This can be very suitable concerning my home situation. A bug plus is off course a good looking paycheck, but
        the joy to go to work is more important than money.</p>
