        <h3>Where i stand?</h3>
        <p>In the course of my training I have learned many new things. The biggest is my motivation for this education
            to be achieved successfully. My motivation was already high before I enrolled, but this is more as the
            program progresses
            grown. This motivation has also helped me grow personally. Where I first had doubts about doing something or
            I now dare to ask for help much faster when needed. Collaborating with colleagues and each other
            helping has also been an important aspect in this. Social skills have improved as a result and you can
            helping others who are having a hard time with an assignment/project.</p>

    <div class="divbody" id="Sterkpunt">
        <h3>Strong points</h3>
        <p>One of my strongest points is my helpfulness. If I can help other people move forward, it gives
            this my joy. For this course I sometimes pushed myself backwards because of this, but from this I have
            learned that I also have to think about myself regularly and that I can't always help everyone. In this
            training, I honed my social skills by consulting with colleagues</p>

        <h3>Workpoints</h3>
        <p>
            Something I'm still struggling with and I'm working on planning my projects. When I can make a schedule
            I do not always adhere to this due to the fact that unforeseen situations quickly occur. There will be a
            link to this
            also procrastination for thinking that I should better set my priorities.</p>
