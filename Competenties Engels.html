<div class="divbody1">
  <h3>Designer</h3>
  <p>As a designer I can use my creativity. I can do fairly well on the basis of an assignment that has been given to me
    estimate the time it takes to reach the goal. Currently my knowledge is still limited to HTML for
    designing websites and for designing with the .NET framework I have also mastered the XAML.
    If there are technical challenges, I look up information about this on the web or discuss with colleagues what the
    possibilities to implement this. For my own I feel that I am well on my way as a designer
    to be able to deal with this professionally. Pretty quickly I realized that designing is something
    me lies.</p>

<div class="divbody2">
  <h3>Programmer</h3>
  <p>Programming is a great part of the IT world. My knowledge is not yet big enough in this
    complete assignment. On the basis of an assignment I know what needs to be done and in which direction
    must go out. But from my own experience I also feel that I still have a lot of work to do here. One
    big
    I can write part of a code independently. But until now I still often collide with the final finish of one
    code. For this I am still practicing a lot and I am gradually growing to one
    full-fledged programmer.</p>

<div class="divbody1">
  <h3>Tester</h3>
  <p>Testing my projects is very useful when I'm working on a project. I learned that if
    I am working on a project this can help to get further.
    Especially when I am busy programming an application, this has often helped me when I
    got stuck somewhere. As a tester, I still have a basic knowledge that I still have to expand by learning more
    find out what other tools are out there</p>
</div>
<div class="divbody2">
  <h3>Teamplayer</h3>
  <p> A very important aspect of a project is the communication between the people you work with. This is
    a very important fact for me because you can help each other and learn from each other. Gradually my
    trajectory I have noticed that I am strong in this because when a question is asked, I do everything I can
    will do to solve the problem. One point I need to work on is daring to ask questions myself
    and don't think that I'm causing a nuisance with this.</p>
</div>
<div class="divbody3">
  <h3>Lifelong learning in IT</h3>
  <p>In the course of my career I have noticed how quickly the IT world can change. When I started my
    I thought I already had quite a bit of knowledge of IT, but I still have a lot in my education
    learned. By working on my education, I have paid more attention to what is going on in the IT world
    happened and I will also continue to follow this up so that I can keep up with the evolution of this, possibly later
    contribute to the evolution of the IT sector.</p>
