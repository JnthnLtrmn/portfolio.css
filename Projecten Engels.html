        <h3>Dutch entry test</h3>
        <p>Assignment: Test to test your Dutch language skills.</p>
        <p>Personal challenge: After years of not attending school, it was a challenge to get in used to the fact to
            study again and take tests again.</p>
        <p>Learned: From this I learned that my knowledge of Dutch is unchanged and that it's something I'm
            still good at.</p>

            honestly.</p>
        <p>Lesson learned: The feedback report broadly reflected what I knew about myself. The fun thing was
            the detailed explanation you receive per soft skill.</p>

            that you could determine whether the direction being followed is something that suits me.</p>

            That you have applied in situations that you have experienced. </p>
        <p>
            Personal challenge: The challenge with this assignment was that you had to judge yourself, which is not
            always
            easy. You had to be able to decide for yourself what you did well or badly in a given situation </p>
        <p>Lesson learned: Thinking about these situations has shown me that I act right more often.</p>

        <h3>Planning assingment</h3>
        <p>Assignment: draw up a schedule over a period of 2 weeks in which you plan your daily
            activities.</p>
        <p>Personal challenge: Planning was not my strong point, for this assignment I had to think about
            the right balance between studying, free time and family.</p>
        <p>Learned: By carrying out this assignment and being busy with this training, I am aware of it on how important
            planning is. I now use this more often and this allows me to work in a more structured way .</p>
